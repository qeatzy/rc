{{{ match title, case insensitive can only achieved with regex.

Regardless of the current TitleMatchMode, WinTitle, WinText, ExcludeTitle and ExcludeText are case sensitive. The only exception is the case-insensitive option of the RegEx mode;
SetTitleMatchMode RegEx 
randomsale := 15
#if (randomsale = 15) AND WinActive("(notepad)$")!
msgbox, active
return

    SetTitleMatchMode, RegEx
    WinWaitActive, i)%var%
    MsgBox Active

Don't you have to close the directive? Or is it not necessary? Like below?
No. Any #ifwinactive automatically overrides the previous #ifwinactive directive.

In your example, the {} after #ifwinactive aren't needed.
