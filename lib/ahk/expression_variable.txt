IniWrite, a[1]`,a[2], asdf.ini, Other, A
  A=5,3         # need this
  A=a[1],a[2]   # got this
How do I properly address an array element in a Command call? 
You need to force it into expression syntax, then you need to write it in
expression syntax, like this:
  IniWrite, % a[1] "," a[2], asdf.ini, Other, A
Thanks! Is there also a way to use arrays as Output variables (which don't allow forced expression syntax, according to the docs)? 
  In that case, you have to use regular variables, then assign them to your array elements afterwards.
..
Any command that expects an InputVar/OutputVar requires a variable.

Loop % (array:=["this", "is", "a", "test"]).length()

== is case-sensitive-equal (in expression)?
Yes. But = is not.
