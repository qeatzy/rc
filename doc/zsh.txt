@Le_Katz, ZDOTDIR=x zsh only sets ZDOTDIR for that zsh process (it adds
 ZDOTDIR=x to the environment that that zsh receives), there's nothing to put
 back after that zsh has exited (and .zlogout is only evaluated for login
 shells) you might still want to unset ZDOTDIR from within your startup
 scripts if you don't want other zsh instanced called by that zsh to inherit
 it. – Stéphane Chazelas May 30 '14 at 13:50
