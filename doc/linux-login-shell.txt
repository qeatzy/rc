If your login shell can't be executed on some machine, then you can't log into it over SSH, or by most other methods for that matter. The SSH server always executes your login shell. If you pass a command on the ssh command line then the login shell is executed with -c and the command stringÂ¹ as arguments; otherwise the login shell is executed as a login shell with no argument.
